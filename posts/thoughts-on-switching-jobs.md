This blog post will be a little different; it will be more for myself but also share openly my reasons and experience. This way, I can look back and reflect on how switching my job for the first time was like.

## Introduction

After nearly five years at my first job post-college, I’ve taken the leap and switched roles for the first time. It wasn’t an easy decision, especially since BlackRock had so much to offer and I’d made some great friends there. But life is about growth, right?

I found my passion for Front-end engineering while at BlackRock, even though I started with almost no experience in it. Over time, I learned a lot and saw a clear path for growth and promotion. There were exciting projects central to the company’s strategy, but I found myself less invested in them and the overall mission.

Then, I came across an opportunity at Coinbase that felt tailor-made for me. I’ve been passionate about crypto for a long time—so much so that at BlackRock, I was known as the “crypto guy.” My colleagues often reached out to discuss Bitcoin, and I was always vocal about my thoughts on the future of crypto. I’ve believed in its use case and transparency since 2017 when I first used Coinbase to invest in Bitcoin during college. Funny enough, during the Bitcoin downturn in 2019, I even gave a presentation to my fellow BlackRock interns about Bitcoin’s potential! *(Bitcoin was worth $11,000 at the time)*

Over the years, I’ve invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum, not just financially but by actively participating in the Ethereum ecosystem through NFTs and Dapps. So, when the chance to join Coinbase came up, it was a no-brainer. Being one of Coinbase’s early users made this opportunity even more exciting.

## The Switch and Reasons

Switching jobs is always a big decision, especially when you’re happy where you are. But I’ve always believed in keeping my eyes open for the right opportunities. I always thought there are a few companies and positions out there that could offer even more exciting challenges and growth. So, I kept learning, growing my skills, and staying on the lookout for that perfect fit.

### The Decision Checklist

When it came down to it, I asked myself these critical questions:

1.	Would I regret declining the offer?
2.	Am I excited about the company’s products, mission, and direction?
3.	Is the type and focus of the work aligned with my interests?
4.	How does the compensation compare?
5.	Is remote working an option?
6.	What are the learning opportunities?

I’d interviewed with a few companies before, and while some were interesting, many didn’t tick all the boxes—even if the compensation was higher. I wasn’t unhappy at BlackRock. In fact, I was pretty excited about some of the work there. But when Coinbase came into the picture, it checked off all the points on my list.

Joining Coinbase was a no-brainer. Yes, it was a risk—leaving behind a place where I was happy and had great benefits. But the excitement of new challenges and aligning with a company I genuinely believe in made the decision easy.

### Connections and Reflections

One of the biggest takeaways from my switch is the incredible connections I made at BlackRock. These are friendships and professional relationships that I’ll carry with me for life. I hope our paths cross again in the future, and I plan to stay in touch with many of the fantastic people I met. And yes, I’ll definitely miss those daily ping pong matches at the Atlanta office!

## The Interview Process

The interview process at Coinbase was quite the marathon, but it was impressively organized. Coinbase did an excellent job of over-communicating, making sure I never felt left in the dark. It was clear they cared about finding the right candidates and respecting our time.

I applied in April 2024 and went through several phases, finally receiving the offer in June 2024. Here’s a breakdown of the steps:

1.	Resume screening
2.	IQ test and culture fit quiz
3.	Phone call with recruiter
4.	Take-home React front-end test (1.5 hours)
5.	Call with recruiter and recruiting manager (team assignment)
6.	Live interviews scheduling
7.	Three live interviews: one behavioral and two React front-end technical
8.	Offer received: 1.5 weeks later

Conclusion

Switching jobs for the first time was a mix of excitement and challenges, but it was worth every moment. I’m thrilled to be starting this new chapter at Coinbase, and I’m grateful for the experiences and connections I made at BlackRock. Here’s to new adventures and continuous growth!

Hope you enjoyed my thoughts and experience switching jobs for the first time and can take away some insights from it.
